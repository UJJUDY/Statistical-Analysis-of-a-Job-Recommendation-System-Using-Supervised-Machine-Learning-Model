In this code snippet, I have covered a wide array of tasks related to data analysis, preprocessing, and modeling.

Firstly, I imported necessary libraries and read the dataset, then cleaned the data by handling missing values and categorizing age and salary. My exploration of the data included creating visualizations like bar plots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps to gain insights into the dataset's relationships.

I conducted hypothesis testing using a one-sample t-test to explore the mean age of the sample. Feature engineering was a significant part of the process, involving tasks like creating new features and encoding techniques.

Moving on to modeling, I trained logistic regression and k-Nearest Neighbors models for prediction tasks, assessing their performance using accuracy scores.

Additionally, I implemented a recommendation system based on cosine similarity, allowing users to receive personalized job recommendations based on their skills and industry interests.

To improve the code, I plan to ensure consistency in formatting and commenting for better readability. Handling potential errors during preprocessing and modeling is crucial, and I aim to optimize the modeling process by tuning hyperparameters and exploring alternative algorithms. Validating the recommendation system with real user feedback will also be beneficial for refinement.

Overall, this code demonstrates my understanding of various data science techniques and showcases a comprehensive approach to analysis and modeling. With further refinement and optimization, it could be even more effective for real-world applications.

The results and discussion encompass various aspects of the analysis, including descriptive statistics, performance metrics for machine learning models, hypothesis testing, variables distribution, and recommendations for system improvement.

Descriptive Statistics provide insights into the numerical dataset's standard deviation, mean distribution, minimum values, and percentile distributions. Additionally, Figure 7 shows the dataset's initial state, indicating the presence of empty rows that required manual input for analysis.

Machine Learning Models The KNN classifier achieved an accuracy of 50%, which was enhanced through grid search tuning. In contrast, the Random Forest classifier had an accuracy of only 2.1%, indicating inferior performance compared to KNN.

Recommendation System Visualization presents a bubble chart illustrating connections between educational background, desired firm, industry, and career type, facilitating trend-spotting in job seeker preferences.

Chi-Square Test depict the chi-squared test analysis for correlating categorical parameters, such as academic discipline and projected income, and their significance in contributing to the recommendation system.

T-Test Hypothesis:shows the results of the one-sample t-test conducted on the dataset, exploring the distribution of the tested variable (age) and its correlation with the recommendation system.

Variables Distribution display the distribution of features like salary expectation and age, providing insights into their associations.

Testing Accuracy compares accuracy scores for different K values in logistic regression and KNN models, essential for assessing model effectiveness.

Conclusion The job recommendation system demonstrated a 50% accuracy in suggesting employment based on student profiles. Despite limitations like dataset reliance and lack of real-time labor market consideration, the system holds promise for aiding student job searches. Future improvements include integrating additional data sources, creating a mobile app, and employing more complex machine learning techniques.

Issues and Observations: Limitations of the model include dataset robustness, lack of consideration for real-time labor market conditions, and potential improvements in feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and dataset size.

In summary, while the recommendation system shows promise, addressing these limitations and implementing proposed improvements can enhance its effectiveness and practicality for addressing youth unemployment and underemployment issues.
